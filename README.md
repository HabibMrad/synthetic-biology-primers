# Synthetic Biology Papers Reading Roadmap

> If you are a newcomer to the field of Synthetic Biology area, the first question you may have is "What exactly is this convoluted area of hype?", or more importantly, "Which paper should I start reading from?"

> There are a few floating definitions of Synthetic Biology, but the [wikedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology) gives a great one sentance summary that I like the most: _Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary branch of biology and engineering._

Our capacity to design biology requires working knowledge of:

* Biology
* Biochemistry
* Biophysics
* Bioinformatics
* Computational Biology
* Systems Biology
* Statistics
* Computer Science
* Control Theory
* Electrical Engineering
* Chemical Engineering
* Ethics and Bioethic
* Manufacturing and Process Engineering
* Data Science and Machine Learning

As so, here you'll find papers in these disciplines as they relate to Synthetic Biology. I've also listed out the list of resources that go into my RSS feed [here](https://github.com/francisglee/synthetic-biology-roadmap/raw/master/resources.md). Each section is organized into the following:

1.  Reviews
2.  State of the art

This list is curated by Francis Lee. Please contact me at francis dot g dot lee at gmail dot com for comments and updates!
